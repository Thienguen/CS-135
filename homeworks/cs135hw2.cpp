      What beta1 does is take the value that the user inputs for beta, and
      converts it into radians.
      You put the value into beta when it instructs you to (degrees),
      then this function will turn that value into radians
      in order to make the other calculations have the correct values.

      What alpha is doing is taking the formula for alpha(Î±) and converting
      it into radians.
      Once you put the value for beta, alpha takes that value and applies
      it to the formula for alpha, then converts it into radians.

      chordLength and radius just takes those newly acquired values, and
      applies them into the formula provided in the assignment.
